# Classification---IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Performance

Objective: To build models using all classification algorithms other than neural networks and and compare the accuracy using methods discussed with them Uncovering the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’. Finally, predicting the “Attrition” from this data set.

1. Did basic analysis and Visualization of all the columns and select the columns which you feel are relevant for solving the problem statement. (Don’t forget to preprocess your data)
2. Explored different scoring metrics (like F1 score, accuracy, precision, etc.) and selected the most relevant.
3. Experimented with different classification algorithms and Didn't forget to perform hyperparameter tuning on these models
4. Made sure to provide import features for at least one of the models
5. Finally in conclusion section made sure to compare all my models
